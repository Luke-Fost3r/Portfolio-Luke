# Portfolio-Luke


My name is Luke, and this is my current portfolio. I am always looking for new challenges and ideas for programs, below are simply the ones I have refined the farthest so far. I plan to add multiple more projects soon, likely including a cypher program to send extremely coded messages, a chess robot, and some neural network image identifiers.
I am Enthusiastic and facinated with writing code, and the theory behind it, currently and especially in deep learning. I hope that through this portfolio I will expand my experience, and create more and more interesting projects.

Some of my major inspirations include Alan Turing, science fiction books (Hyperion & The Invincible), and ai philosophy. 

                                                                                                                                             
Feel free to explore, and see how I approached different problems
